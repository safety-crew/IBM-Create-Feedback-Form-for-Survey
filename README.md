# IBM-Create-Feedback-Form-for-Survey
### What I learnt
In this lab, I created a feedback form using React functional components and manage user details using the `useState` hook. I implemented event handlers to manage form input changes, validate user inputs, and handle form submissions. Additionally, I created a confirmation dialog using the confirm method to confirm user details before final submission. Upon successful submission, I resetd the form fields and display a thank you message to the user. This lab gave me practical experience building interactive forms and handling user inputs in React applications.
### Learning objectives
After completing this lab, I was able to:
- Create a form to collect user feedback, including their name, email, and the feedback message.
- Handle form submission, including data validation, to ensure that the users enter their names and provide feedback before submitting the form.
- Display a confirmation dialog to users after they submit their feedback, showing the information they entered and prompting them to confirm before final submission.
- Reset the form fields to clear the input values and provide users with a clean form for submitting additional feedback.
